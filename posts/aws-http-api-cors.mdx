title: Configuring CORS in AWS HTTP API

I recently completed a project where I built a HTTP API in AWS API Gateway. The relatively new HTTP API,
while RESTful, has some significant differences from REST API. One of those differences is the way in which you
configure CORS. If you're accustomed to using REST API, you might know that configuring CORS is fairly intuitive.
I didn't find that to be the case with HTTP API. This post documents the implementation for the benefit of my
future self, and anyone else who might run into the same issues I did.

Read the preamble, or skip to the solution.

Troubleshooting CORS errors becomes a lot easier once you understand what a preflight OPTIONS request does.
If you've ever made a call to a cross-domain API from a frontend application, you might've noticed there are
two requests that occur when a call to the API endpoint is initiated. The first of those requests is called a preflight
OPTIONS request. The preflight request is an interstitial request that your browser makes to the server. The browser
makes a preflight request in order to retrieve the header attributes that describe what request data is allowed and
expected by that server. If the preflight request is successful (the response returns 200 OK), then it will attempt
to make the second request--the call to the API endpoint initiated by your application code.

If you only test your API in a desktop client like Postman, preflight errors can go unnoticed for awhile. CORS errors
will never appear in Postman because the request is never routed through a browser.

CORS errors can occur for several reasons. Sometimes they can be misleading, and indicative of other issues in your
application that aren't directly related to the preflight request. In this case, we're concerned only with errors
related to proper handling of the preflight OPTIONS request. When the browser isn't able to successfully make this
request, you'll see the classic CORS error that we all know and despise.

You can check the status of the preflight request by inspecting the network requests that your application is making.
You should see a request labeled 'preflight', sent with OPTIONS as the request method. If the status code in the
response indicates an error, then you likely need to configure your server side code and infrastructure to allow the
preflight request, and return the headers that the browser expects to receive.

## The client side code

All CORS configuration is handled on the server side. If you're new to CORS errors, you might assume the problem lies
within the frontend code, and that perhaps you're not sending the correct headers in the request.

In fact, there's very little required of the frontend. Assuming your API call is sending a JSON payload, and some
form of Authorization, the only headers you need are `Content-Type` and `Authorization`. You should ensure that
your frontend code is sending only those headers required by the server, and nothing more. Adding more headers than
are necessary can sometimes cause further problems, and prevent you from finding the true source of your CORS error.

```js
    // A GET request made with Axios
    const token = await getJWT();
    const resp = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/jobs`, {
        headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
            }
        })
    const data = await resp?.data;
    ...
```

## The server side code

Your server side code should be doing two things:
1. Allowing a browser to complete a preflight OPTIONS request
2. Returning all the headers that the browser expects to receive in the preflight response

I've provided some examples of how to achieve this in a simple Flask API. The guidance applies regardless of whether
you're using AWS Lambda or a back-end framework to construct your API.

In order to return the required headers in every response, the easiest thing to do is use the .

```python
    import flask
    from flask_cors import CORS

    # App Configuration ---------------

    app = flask.Flask("my-api")
    # Provides headers required by a cross-origin request
    CORS(app)
```

The important bit in this code snippet is the addition of `OPTIONS` in the list of allowed methods.

```python
    @ms_api_routes.route("/jobs", methods=['GET', 'OPTIONS'])
    def list_jobs():
        """
        Accepts GET and OPTIONS methods
        """
        try:
            if request.method == 'OPTIONS':
                return jsonify(message="OK")

        # ...the rest of your code
```
