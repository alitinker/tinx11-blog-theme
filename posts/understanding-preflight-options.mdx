Troubleshooting CORS errors becomes a lot easier once you understand what a preflight OPTIONS request does.
If you've ever made a call to a cross-domain API from a frontend application, you might've noticed there are
two requests that occur when a call to the API endpoint is initiated. The first of those requests is called a preflight
OPTIONS request.

The preflight request is an interstitial request that your browser makes to the server. Meaning, it's a request that's
automatically initiated by the browser just after some client side code fires off a request to an API endpoint.

The browser makes this preflight request in order to retrieve the header attributes describing what request data
is allowed and expected by that server. If the preflight request is successful (the response returns 200 OK), then it
will attempt to make the second request (the call to the API endpoint initiated by your application code).

Preflight OPTIONS requests are made when:
1. A cross-origin POST or PUT request is sent
2. _Any_ cross-origin request is sent that includes the `Authorization` header

A preflight request is _always_ made prior to a cross-origin POST request. You won't see a preflight request made
prior to GET requests unless you're sending the `Authorization` header in the GET request.

If you only test your API in a desktop client like Postman, preflight errors can go unnoticed for awhile. CORS errors
will never appear in Postman because the request is never routed through a browser.

CORS errors can occur for several reasons. Sometimes they can be misleading, and indicative of other issues in your
application that aren't directly related to the preflight request. When a browser isn't able to successfully make a
preflight request, you'll see the classic CORS error that we all know and despise.

You can check the status of the preflight request by inspecting the network requests being fired by your front-end
application. You should see a request labeled 'preflight', sent with OPTIONS as the request method. If the status
code in the response indicates an error, then you likely need to configure your server side code and infrastructure
to allow the preflight request, and return the headers that the browser expects to receive.

There are several possible reasons why a CORS error is happening. Improper handling of a preflight request is just one
of those reasons. Other causes include, but are not limited to:
1. Improper (or lack of) error handling in the back-end code
2. Incorrect headers being sent in the front-end request
